Last night I went to Zappa Plays Zappa, the show where [Dweezil Zappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dweezil_Zappa) and a group of very talented musicians performs [Frank Zappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Zappa) songs. It was an amazing show. Jen and I were especially impressed with [Scheila Gonzalez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheila_Gonzalez), who played several instruments perfectly, including a downright amazing saxophone solo, and sang with amazing range.

Since it's the 40th anniversary of the album [One Size Fits All](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Size_Fits_All_(Frank_Zappa_album)), they played most of the album before doing other hits. If you're not familiar with Zappa or the album [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUxJQlOKj38&t=16m26s) and listen to about a minute of it. We sat in  the third row left of center, right in front of the trumpet  / trombone / guitar player, so it was pretty freaking loud. Imagine the scene, and then guess what I did.

I fell asleep.

Several times in fact. I was following this loud, intricate cacophony of sound, and then suddenly I'm in a random dream sequence with the music in it, and then I open my eyes back at the show. I wasn't tired before the show started, and after the album finished and they played more standard rock songs I was awake and alert again. Why would the most musically complex music I've ever heard performed live make me fall asleep sitting up?

Here's my theory: as a child my parents would play lots of music, including a lot of Zappa. I would be put to bed at 7 or 8 and they would play One Size Fits All among others while I slept, in an old house with thin walls. Has my brain been trained to associate this music with sleep, to the point where it will put me under in a situation otherwise unconducive to sleep?

If anyone has any insight into this sort of phenomenon, please let me know!

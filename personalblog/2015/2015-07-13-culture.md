I came across this image on Facebook:

It inspired me to add my two cents.

I almost _never_ repost this type of inspirational quote-in-picture media, but here's something we need to repeat over and over.

The society and culture you live in has been carefully guided into place to push the glorification of celebrity and the perfect image. American mainstream culture is not deemed by the masses. Popular culture trends are dependent on the options set in front of the majority of people, and those options often come from the media and news sources, owned by the same people who profit from your weakness.

By creating a constant basis of comparison to an idealized image of perfection, unattainable by most, people will judge themselves harshly, and in secret. The self-doubt leads to fear, and fear is the main motivator for material consumption; either as a temporary solution, a distraction, or an escape.

The confident, self-assured human isn't swayed by advertising for the latest health/cosmetic product. He has no need to drown his self loathing in addictive fast "food". He doesn't need to consume "reality" television.

Emotional stability is not profitable. Confidence is not profitable. But you are not a cash cow. You are an individual, and you are fine just the way you are.

EDIT: Changed some pronouns after a peer review. I don't like using gender-specific pronouns when I'm talking about humanity in general, but until we decide on a gender-neutral singular pronoun there isn't much I can do.

I think it's healthy once a day to go outside and look around. Look up. Take in how static and still the landscape is.

Then think about how you're traveling in a circle at 1000 MPH around the center of the planet, while also moving at 67,000 MPH around the sun, all the while still moving at 45,000 MPH around the center of the galaxy. A galaxy which itself is moving at 1.34 million MPH towards the constellation Hydra

You're never going nowhere, fast.

And if you're a fan of Monty Python, you [already know all this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buqtdpuZxvk).

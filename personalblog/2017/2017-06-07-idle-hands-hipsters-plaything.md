I'm a pretty modern person. I work remotely for a tech company, I've lost count of the number of computers in my home (laptops, old towers, Raspberry Pi's, etc), I even have Tux tattooed on my arm.

And yet I find myself falling into the hipster trappings of my generation; I have a turntable, I vape, and I just bought a french press. And I wonder to myself, why am I doing this? I'm a scarf and v-neck shirt away from hipster bingo!

I think part of the answer is in the manual process. Vinyl might not be the superior audio format (or it might, I don't wanna go there), but when you have to take out a record, lay it down and place a needle, you're gonna really _listen_ to what you're playing.

When you use a french press, you're spending about 10 minutes, from boiling to drinking, just _making coffee_. You're manually pushing the plunger to separate the grounds. You're going to _taste_ that coffee, because you put effort into it.

Even vaping has these trappings. Mind you, I vape in attempt to not smoke. But there's also satisfaction in rolling a new coil, wrapping a wick, etc.

And that's what my generation is missing, the feeling of satisfaction you get from doing something with your hands. These little trappings are like the **gamification of handiwork**; you get the satisfaction of completing a task with your hands, without the effort of any hard work.

What does all this mean? Is this a good or a bad thing? I don't know, I'm only on my first cup of freshly pressed coffee.

From now through Sunday I'll be at Pennapps with Linode, giving out swag, Linode credit, and mentoring where I can! I may also try to do some hacking myself, but I'm not sure if I should be reorganizing my services across different servers, or working on a new project.

These hackathons run 48 hours straight, but I don't know how long I'll last. I'll try to update here as the hours pass.

EDIT: This is what I've come up with so far: [Python Prime Number Generator](https://github.com/alexfornuto/alex-learns-python/blob/master/prime-numbers/init.py)

EDIT #2: I've made another couple of useless site: [GET SCHWIFTY!](http://schwifty.co)Â and [MR MEESEEKS](http://meeseeks.co)
